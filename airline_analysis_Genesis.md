Analyzing Flight Delays and Cancellations by Airlines

Our group project focused on flight cancellations and delays from 2019 to 2023, I concentrated on analyzing and visualizing data related to different airlines. Leveraging a dataset from Kaggle, my efforts were directed towards understanding how various airlines were impacted by delays and cancellations during this timeframe.

Key Activities:

Code Snippet: I extract data from the "AIRLINES" column, calculating the total number of delayed and cancelled flights for each airline. This allowed us to rank the top airlines based on these metrics, revealing significant performance differences among them.

Bar Chart Visualization: In addition to the code-based analysis, I produced a bar chart showing the total number of flights delayed and cancelled by each airline. This chart also highlighted the specific number of flights that were solely cancellations, providing a comprehensive visual representation of the distribution of delays and cancellations across different airlines.

Pie Chart Visualization: To make this data more digestible, I created a pie chart illustrating the proportion of delayed and cancelled flights for each of the top airlines. This visual representation provided a clear comparison of performance metrics, highlighting airlines with higher instances of delays and cancellations.

Line Graph : Additionally, I generated a line graph that depicted the number of flights delayed and canceled by the top five airlines, categorized by month and year. This graphical representation allowed us to identify trends and patterns in each airline's performance over time.


Insights and Contributions:

Through my analysis and visualizations, we gained valuable insights into the performance of different airlines regarding flight disruptions. However, it remains unclear whether airlines experiencing the greatest number of disruptions also have higher flight volumes or simply face more operational challenges. Further investigation is needed to make informed decisions, particularly for travelers seeking reliable and efficient airline services.
